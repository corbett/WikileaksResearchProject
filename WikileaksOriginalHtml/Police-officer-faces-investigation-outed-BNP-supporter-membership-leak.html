We were aware that he has worked for BBC Radio Kent and LBC. <br></p><p>'We were not aware of his membership of the BNP until today. We have no plans to use Rod Lucas in the immediate future.'</p><p>Merseyside Police said: 'We understand that the British National Party names a Steve Bettley for an alleged association with the party.</p><p>'Whether Merseyside PC Steve Bettley was, or is, a member of BNP is subject to an ongoing inquiry.</p><p>'Chief Constable Bernard Hogan-Howe has reiterated our position that membership of the British National Party is totally incompatible with the duties and values of Merseyside Police. <br></p><p>'We will not accept a police officer or police staff being a member of BNP.'</p><p>Officers are banned from joining or promoting the BNP because it would damage race relations, according to the Association of Chief Police Officers.<br></p><p>Since 2004, officers have faced dismissal for being a member of the BNP because of the risk it could damage race relations.</p><p>Hundreds of members had received threatening calls in the last 24 hours since the list was leaked, leader Mr Griffin claimed.<br></p><p>'We're sure that this is a left-wing trick by the unions and the Labour Party. The number of calls, the sheer volume of it can't come from an isolated number of people,' he said.</p><p>Despite his members' fears, he also said publication of their names could ultimately prove 'fantastic' for the party as he appeared with supporters in Burnley today.<br></p><p>'We couldn't have bought the publicity...&nbsp; It's going to show people that we're not a bunch of skinhead morons, which is the left-wing media-created image,' he said.</p><p>'It shows we're far broader than that, a snapshot of decent British society. It will significantly increase our votes next year.'</p><p>BNP spokesman Simon Darby had warned earlier: 'If we find out who published this list, it will turn out to be one of the most foolish things they have done in their life. I wouldn't want to have done that - I wouldn't be sleeping very well tonight.'</p><div class="clear"> </div><div class="clear"> </div>

<p class="imageCaption">'Spiteful': The list on the internet. BNP officials claim it was released by disgruntled ex-employees and warned them they could face jail</p> <div class="clear"> </div> <p>The list includes people's names, addresses and ages as well as other 'relevant' information. Children are also on it because the party has family membership deals.</p><p>Many entries are accompanied by the warning to administrators: 'discretion required, employment concerns'.<br></p><p>Keiron Le-mar, a former soldier who now works for an energy company - was aghast that even his service number had now been released.<br></p><p>'I'm obviously disappointed... I'm worried about that because in my job I go round people's houses. I'm involved in all sorts of walks of life. I don't know how they would look on that. It could make the company look bad,' he told the Times.<br></p><p>'I joined the BNP because I feel they are the people who stand up for Britain as a country. I'm not for the racist views. To be honest, all I've ever got was letters asking for money.'</p><p>Internet chat sites have been flooded with fearful messages since the list emerged. </p><p>One online comment read: 'I'm on the list, I could be chucked out of the Army. What is going on?' <br> </p> <p>Another added: 'This is a disaster for the BNP, both on a PR front and a security level. Heads should roll and I'm afraid that the buck has to stop with the chairman.'</p><p>

Publication was forbidden under a High Court injunction obtained in April. <br></p><p>Mr Darby insisted it was leaked in a 'malevolent and spiteful' move to try to destabilise the party: <br></p><p>'It is part of a dirty tricks campaign and a desperate move by our political opponents,' he said.<br></p><p>He claimed the list contained the names of people who had never been members of the party as well as those of current and former members.</p><p>The person who leaked the material could be prosecuted and fined but the chances of members' successfully suing them or the party over the breach are slim.&nbsp; <br></p><p>It was discovered after people started receiving unsolicited mail and contacted the BNP.</p><p>The party claims it has more than 100 local and parish councillors, the latest of whom was elected in Boston, Lincolnshire, last week. Race tensions are high in the town as migrants make up a quarter of the population.</p><p>It plans to make a major push to win seats in the elections to the European Parliament next June.</p><p>In 2006, it was revealed that Covent Garden ballerina Simone Clarke was a member of the BNP after the party was infiltrated by an undercover journalist.</p><p>It was claimed that activists are encouraged to use false names while on party business and instructs them in the use of software to encrypt emails.</p><p>Many of its members, however, are far from the stereotype of the British far-Right.</p><p> According to reports at the time, one is the American chief executive of a City investment corporation, while another is a servant of the Queen, living at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Labour MPs Margaret Hodge and Jon Cruddas have repeatedly warned of the march of the BNP in East London.</p><p>
